# This hook checks to make sure that the tag being pushed matches the valid
# format "vX.Y.Z" where X, Y, and Z are integers and then checks critical
# files to ensure that the version specified in the tag matches the version
# specified in the file.
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
#
# $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# $2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>
#


# Regex of the valid tag format
tag_regex="^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+"

# Files that contain the version which should match the tag
files=()
files[0]='setup.py'
files[1]='log_generator/__init__.py'
